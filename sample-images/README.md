# 📁 Sample Images Directory

This directory is provided as a default location for testing the Image Manipulator application.

## 📝 Purpose

- **Default Directory**: The application will use this as the default directory if no other path is specified
- **Testing**: Perfect for testing the application without using your personal images
- **Learning**: Safe space to experiment with rotation features

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Add Your Images**: Place some test images in this directory
2. **Start the App**: Run `npm start` and open http://localhost:3000
3. **Test Features**: Try rotating images and using the preview functionality

## 📷 Supported Formats

- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- WebP (.webp)
- GIF (.gif)
- TIFF (.tiff)
- BMP (.bmp)

## 🔒 Safety Note

The application modifies images in place. If you're testing with important images, make sure to:

1. **Create backups** of your original images first
2. **Use test images** in this directory instead
3. **Verify results** before using on important files

## 🎯 Pro Tip

For the best testing experience:
- Add 10-20 test images to see the grid layout in action
- Include images of different sizes and orientations
- Test with different file formats to ensure compatibility
